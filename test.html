<p style="text-align: justify;">Companies need the DevOps environment to ensure their teams aren't working in separate ways. In the beginning, deployment and testing were thought to be separate functions that were done after the design-build. DevOps models enable smoother collaboration between the two organizations in addition to ensuring high standards of quality and addressing problems and potential bottlenecks. To accomplish the following objectives businesses rely heavily on DevOps models:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Collaboration has been improved</li>
<li>Rapid delivery</li>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Scalability</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Cost efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that we are aware of the need for companies to create a DevOps culture, let's examine the ways some companies have adopted the DevOps concept and have been able to sustain and thrive in today's competitive digital world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> <strong>Amazon</strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although it may be difficult to understand, Amazon used to run on dedicated servers. Their biggest challenge was to effectively figure out a way to handle the volume of traffic they receive and increase their scalability. Amazon transferred its online retail business onto their cloud platform, the AWS cloud. This helped them solve problems more efficiently, reduce costs, establish the process of continuous deployment, and scale with flexibility. This approach has meant that engineers are now able implement code more quickly and reduce interruptions while increasing revenue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> <strong>Netflix</strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Netflix is a household name with its revolutionary streaming service and shipping DVDs. Netflix employed a huge team of developers to manage their transition to the cloud, but there was no commercial software to aid in this transition. They created the Simian Army and a collection of automated tools that constantly tested the infrastructure while providing insight to solve problems. Because of this, Netflix has been a proponent of automation. They have always used new technology and used them in its DevOps model.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> <strong>Walmart</strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the fierce competition of Amazon within the American market, Walmart had to completely overhaul its business model with their development and innovation in technology department, WalmartLabs in 2011. WalmartLabs employed the DevOps strategy to speed up deployment. They made use of a variety of open-source tools to build applications and also encouraged developers and other to develop reusable logic. This helped them not only to cut down on time, but also made it easier for customers to not have their infrastructure developed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> <strong>Adobe</strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adobe's transition from a packaged software model to a cloud-based one has enabled it to drastically enhance the speed of delivery and management of its products. CloudMunch's DevOps platform has allowed Adobe to automatize a variety of processes and manage its deployments effectively. The software integrates with developers to select the tools they prefer and offers a multi-project view so developers can observe how changes made to one Adobe product impact other Adobe products.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> <strong>Sony Pictures Entertainment</strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The entertainment behemoth was confronted with a variety of growing problems in their transition to the cloud. Manual processes were the primary issue for Sony Pictures Entertainment's Digital Media Group (DMG) implemented an automated cloud delivery system that consists of open-source tools as well as a blend of SaaS solutions. This has drastically improved delivery and deployment times, and also the way Sony manages its media assets and presents its content to the end-users.</p>
